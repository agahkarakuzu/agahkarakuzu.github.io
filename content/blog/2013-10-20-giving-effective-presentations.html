<p>Today, I gave a talk in our weekly departmental seminar about giving effective presentations. Here are the slides I used. Not all of them may make sense without the accompanying oral presentation. (There’s one slide in particular where I purposefully tell a different story than the slide does.) However, most of the material should make sense as is.</p>
<p>If anything is unclear, please ask questions in the comments!</p>
