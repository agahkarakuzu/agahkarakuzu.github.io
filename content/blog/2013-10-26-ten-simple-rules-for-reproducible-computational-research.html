<p>PLOS Computational Biology just published a new addition to their popular <a href="https://collections.plos.org/ten-simple-rules">“ten simple rules”</a> series:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sandve GK, Nekrutenko A, Taylor J, Hovig E (2013) Ten Simple Rules for Reproducible Computational Research. PLoS Comput Biol 9(10): e1003285. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285">doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003285</a></p>

<p>This article is relevant to anybody who wants to do computational research. I’ll make it required reading in my lab. For every single one of these rules, I can think of projects I’ve been involved with<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> that ran into trouble or failed because they violated that rule.</p>
<p>While all of the rules are important, I’m particularly partial to these four: avoid manual data manipulation, record all intermediate results, always store raw data behind plots, and provide public access to scripts and results. They will prevent a lot of headaches for both you and the people coming after you who’d like to build on your results.</p>
