I am a postdoctoral researcher at [NeuroPoly Lab](https://neuro.polymtl.ca/), Polytechnique Montreal, where I recently obtained my Ph.D. on end-to-end standardization of quantitative MRI methods through the development of vendor-neutral pulse sequences ([VENUS](https://qmrlab.org/VENUS)), community data standards ([qMRI-BIDS](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.44)), and open-source post-processing workflows ([qMRLab](http://qmrlab.org)). To extend the scope of transparency from scanner to publication, I am leading the development of [NeuroLibre](https://neurolibre.org), a preprint server for reproducible neuroscience notebooks. 

I am an active contributor to several open-source neuroimaging initiatives ([BrainHack](https://brainhack.org/), [MRathon](https://mrathon.github.io), [Open MR](https://openmrbenelux.github.io/), [MRI Together](https://mritogether.esmrmb.org/), [OHBM OSR](https://ohbm.github.io/osr)), as well as to science communication/publication platforms ([MRM Highlights](https://blog.ismrm.org/category/highlights/), [OHBM Blog](https://www.ohbmbrainmappingblog.com), and [ISMRM MR Pulse](https://blog.ismrm.org/), [MRPub](https://ismrm.github.io/mrpub)).
