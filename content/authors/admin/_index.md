I have recently obtained my PhD degree from NeuroPoly Lab at Polytechnique Montreal (supervisor Dr. Nikola Stikov). 

My research focuses on bringing [quantitative MRI (qMRI) applications under one umbrella](https://qmrlab.org) through data standardization, vendor-neutral pulse sequence development, fully transparent & reproducible workflows and community building.

My motivation for open science is born from a combination of open-source development _(BrainHack, MRathon, OpenMR)_ and science communication _(MRM Highlights, OHBM Blog, ISMRM's MRPulse)_.
