I am a PhD candidate at NeuroPoly Lab under the supervision of Dr. Nikola Stikov. 

My current research focuses on bringing [quantitative MRI (qMRI) applications under one umbrella](https://qmrlab.org) through data standardization, vendor-neutral acquisitions, fully transparent & reproducible workflows and community building.

My motivation for open science is born from a combination of open-source development _(BrainHack, MRathon, OpenMR)_ and science communication _(MRM Highlights, OHBM Blog, ISMRM's MRPulse)_.
