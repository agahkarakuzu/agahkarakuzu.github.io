abstract: Uncertainty is a key component of statistical inference. However, uncertainty
  is not easy to convey effectively in data visualizations. For example, viewers have a 
  tendency to interpret visualizations of the most likely outcome as the only possible
  one. Viewers may also misjudge the likelihood of different possible outcomes or the
  extent to which moderately rare outcomes may deviate from the expectation. One way in
  which we can help the viewer grasp the amount of uncertainty present in a dataset is by
  showing a variety of different possible modeling outcomes at once. For example, in a
  linear regression, we could plot a number of different regression lines with slopes and
  intercepts drawn from the range of likely values, as determined by the variation in the
  data. Such visualizations are called Hypothetical Outcomes Plots (HOPs). HOPs can be
  made in static form, showing the various hypothetical outcomes all at once, or
  preferably in an animated form, where the display cycles between the different
  hypothetical outcomes. With recent progress in ggplot2-based animation, via gganimate,
  as well as packages such as tidybayes that make it easy to generate hypothetical
  outcomes, we can easily produce animated HOPs in a few lines of R code. This
  presentation will cover the key concepts, packages, and techniques to generate such
  visualizations.
