abstract: In this keynote, I talk about open workflows, comparing them to a journey to the center of a multi-layered neuroimaging globe. Where does workflow transparency mean in the context of brain research with modern MRI scanners? It is likely that the answer depends on where you stand in the multilayered globe of neuroimaging. On the surface, the coast is clear. But, what about the lower layers that make up the planet? To dig deeper, we need to make every layer visible.
