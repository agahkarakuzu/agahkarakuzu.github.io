abstract: The arrival of Docker containers has revolutionized the way software is developed, tested and pushed to production. Billions of containers are spawn on a weekly basis to deliver some of the most frequently used web services. We unknowingly benefit from this technology doing a web search on Google at work, on an Uber ride back home and watching our favorite TV shows on Netflix. But, how do we foster the use of containers to boost reproducibility and efficiency in the scientific realm? Following a hands-on Introduction to Docker and Binder, we will briefly explore some example use cases of container technology in creating reproducible computational workflows and mapping them onto supercomputers!
