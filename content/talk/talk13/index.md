abstract: Vendor-neutral sequences (VENUS) shines bright in a dark proprietary sky to shine some light on unifying qMRI pulse sequence implementations. In this talk, I am presenting preliminary findings from our first multicenter VENUS experiment with a single participant and the ISMRM/NIST system phantom on 3 clinical (3T) scanners.
