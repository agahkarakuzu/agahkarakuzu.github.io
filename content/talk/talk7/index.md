abstract: Docker can run frozen environments inside lightweight boxes isolated from your host machine. When you have many containers running, it becomes a "kingdom of isolation". So Docker basically "lets you run". I used a concrete buildings vs spartan container houses analogy to explain the differences between VMs and containers. I came up with real-estate commercials, highlighting powerful aspects of both.
