abstract: The ggtext package provides various functions to add formatted text to ggplot2
  figures, both in the form of plot or axis labels and in the form of text labels or text
  boxes inside the plot panel. Text formatting can be achieved through a small subset of
  markdown, HTML, and CSS directives. Features currently supported include italics, bold,
  super- and sub-script, as well as changing font size, font family, and color. Basic support
  for adding images to formatted text is also available.
