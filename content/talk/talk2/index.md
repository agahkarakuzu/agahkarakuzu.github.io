abstract: In this presentation, I tried to breakdown the components of a data visualization practice that facilitates the creation of "repeatable" figures. If you can print something into a static PDF, it means that you are allowed to share data (at least) on that level. Why hide those data points in a scatter plot or even worse, in a bar plot ðŸ™€! For those willing to go the extra mile, I teach how to develop a Dash application and how to deploy it to production.
