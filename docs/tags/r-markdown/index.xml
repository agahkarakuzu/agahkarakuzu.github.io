&lt;p&gt;I’m very excited to announce my latest project, a book on data visualization. The working title is “Fundamentals of Data Visualization”. The book will be published with O’Reilly, and a preview is &lt;a href=&#34;https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/&#34;&gt;available here.&lt;/a&gt; The entire book is written in R Markdown, and the figures are made with ggplot2. The source for the book is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz&#34;&gt;available on github.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the entire book is written in R Markdown, it is not a book on programming. The book is meant as a guide to making visualizations that accurately reflect the data, tell a story, and look professional. It has grown out of my experience of working with students and postdocs in my laboratory on thousands of data visualizations. Over the years, I have noticed that the same issues arise over and over. I have attempted to collect my accumulated knowledge from these interactions in the form of this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, approximately half of the planned chapters are completed, and all completed chapters are available online. I will post future chapters as they become available. Since this is a work in progress, not everything may be completely finalized, and I may rewrite some of the posted chapters at a later date. I welcome feedback. If you see any errors or other problems, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/clauswilke/dataviz/issues&#34;&gt;open an issue on github.&lt;/a&gt; If you have suggestions for other topics to cover, or for datasets that would work well for certain chapters, please also feel free to record these suggestions as issues on github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With very few exceptions, all figures in the book are generated straight from ggplot2, with no manual post-processing in photoshop or illustrator. (At present, the only exception is two figures in the chapter on &lt;a href=&#34;https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/image-file-formats.html&#34;&gt;image file formats.&lt;/a&gt;) Therefore, the book also serves as a showcase of what ggplot2 can do. I am using the bleeding edge of ggplot2 software development, though. To reproduce all the figures in the book, you may have to install current development versions of several R packages.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>R Markdown, the easiest and most elegant approach to writing about data analysis with R</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This weekend, I finally spent some time learning &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;R Markdown&lt;/a&gt;. I had been aware of its existence for a while, but I had never bothered to check it out. What a mistake. R Markdown rocks! It&amp;rsquo;s hands down the easiest and most elegant method to creating rich documents that contain data analysis, figures, mathematical formulas, and text. And it&amp;rsquo;s super easy to learn. I wager that anybody who has RStudio installed can create a useful document in 30 minutes or less. So if you use R, and you&amp;rsquo;ve never used R Markdown, give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R Markdown provides a literate programming platform for the R language. Literate programming, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;invented by Donald Knuth,&lt;/a&gt; allows users to write both a program and a document describing the program, at the same time. In the case of R, this means that you can write a document that contains R code, the output that is generated when the R code is run (including graphs), and prose describing the R code and its output. To give you an example, I started writing a tutorial for R&amp;rsquo;s ggplot2 library this weekend, and the original R Markdown file as well as the HTML output generated from that file are &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/wilkelab/ggplot2_cookbook/blob/master/README.md&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;available here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does the word &lt;em&gt;Markdown&lt;/em&gt; stand for? &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; is a minimalist approach to writing strutured documents. It consists of plain text with a few simple directives to mark sections, turn text bold or italics, or insert quotes. If you have ever edited a wikipedia article, you have used Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give you an example, this is Markdown text:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;We can make text **bold**, *italics*, or `look like code.`
We can also insert links, [e.g. to wikipedia,](http://www.wikipedia.org/)
we can quote things:  

&amp;gt; It is time to eat &amp;amp;#8212; Hungry John

or make lists:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will be rendered like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can make text &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;italics&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;look like code.&lt;/code&gt; We can also insert links, &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.wikipedia.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;e.g. to wikipedia,&lt;/a&gt; we can quote things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time to eat &amp;#8212; Hungry John&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or make lists:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item 1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Item 3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;R Markdown works the same, only that it adds the option to insert R code  blocks. An R code block could look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;```{r}  
# place R code here, e.g. to make a plot:  
library(ggplot2)  
x &amp;lt;- 1:10; y &amp;lt;- x^2  
qplot(x, y)  
```
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you convert the R Markdown file to HTML, the R code gets executed, the R output captured and inserted into the document, and you&amp;rsquo;ve got everything nicely together, with very little work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To create an R Markdown document in RStudio, all you have to do is go to &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;New File&lt;/code&gt;, and then select &lt;code&gt;R Markdown&lt;/code&gt;. Accept the default settings, and R Studio will generate a new R Markdown file with a few lines of example content. To convert the file into HTML, simply click on the &amp;ldquo;Knit HTML&amp;rdquo; button. If you have previously stored your R Markdown file somewhere on your harddisk (with suffix &lt;code&gt;.Rmd&lt;/code&gt;), RStudio will automatically save the generated HTML file in the same location, with the same name and suffix &lt;code&gt;.html&lt;/code&gt;. The HTML file is self-contained, including all images, so it&amp;rsquo;s easy to publish it on a web page or share it with people. RStudio also provides you with the option to publish the document online on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://rpubs.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;RPubs&lt;/a&gt; website. Just click on the &amp;ldquo;Publish&amp;rdquo; button in the HTML view.&lt;/p&gt;
