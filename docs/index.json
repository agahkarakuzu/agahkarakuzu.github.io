Where does workflow transparency mean in the context of brain research with modern MRI scanners? It is likely that the answer depends on where you stand in the multilayered globe of neuroimaging. On the surface, the coast is clear. But, what about the lower layers that make up the planet? To dig deeper, we need to make every layer visible.","tags":[],"title":"Transparent workflows - From scanner to publication","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1592393700,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592393700,"objectID":"830a6e08058d67a58fda84f2a5bdbbad","permalink":"/talk/ohbm_brainhack_2020/","publishdate":"2020-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ohbm_brainhack_2020/","section":"talk","summary":"I took a spaghetti script written in MATLAB and turned it into an understandable and reusable code living happily in a powerful GitHub repository.","tags":[],"title":"Divide and Conquer m-scripts","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1591011300,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591011300,"objectID":"90bfea58c0c8b6965f9ea7ce283b92ca","permalink":"/talk/talk2/","publishdate":"2020-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk2/","section":"talk","summary":"In this presentation, I tried to breakdown the components of a data visualization practice that facilitates the creation of \"repeatable\" figures.

Billions of containers are spawn on a weekly basis to deliver some of the most frequently used web services. We unknowingly benefit from this technology doing a web search on Google at work, on an Uber ride back home and watching our favorite TV shows on Netflix. But, how do we foster the use of containers to boost reproducibility and efficiency in the scientific realm? Following a hands-on Introduction to Docker and Binder, we will briefly explore some example use cases of container technology in creating reproducible computational workflows and mapping them onto supercomputers!","tags":[],"title":"Docker for MRI scientists","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579707000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579707000,"objectID":"2989fa31a2dde2744c4dce16a9db8881","permalink":"/talk/talk5/","publishdate":"2020-10-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/talk5/","section":"talk","summary":"My presentation covering the core concepts of the On Modeling article by Dimitry Novikov, Sune Jespersen and Valerij Kiselev.
